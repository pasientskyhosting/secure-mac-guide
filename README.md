This is a practical guide to using [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/faq/yubikey/) as a SmartCard for storing GPG encryption and signing keys. Keys stored on a SmartCard like YubiKey seem more difficult to steal than ones stored on disk, and are convenient for everyday use..

The blog "[Exploring Hard Tokens](https://www.avisi.nl/blog/2012/01/05/exploring-hard-tokens/)" describes the disadvantages of the combination of a username/password for access control. Passwords can be cracked or retrieved by social engineering. They can be read from faulty systems or even retrieved from unsecured internet access.

Authentication on a workstation often is done by using a username and password. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to detect when an attacker accesses a system. Therefore it is important to strengthen your authentication by adding a second step to your authentication process.

# Purchase YubiKey
We use the YubiKey 4 as it features 4096 bit keys.

You should also buy another YubiKey as a backup key for your computer login, because if you lose your YubiKey, you wont be able to login into your computer.

# Prepare your Macbook

## Enable full disk encryption
Please make sure before you start this process, that your Macbook has enabled FileVault 2 disk encryption.
Apple has an excellent guide here https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837

## Enable Secure Keyboard Entry
Command line users who wish to add an additional layer of security to their keyboarding within Terminal app can find a helpful privacy feature built into the Mac client. Whether aiming for generally increasing security, if using a public Mac, or are simply concerned about things like keyloggers or any other potentially unauthorized access to your keystrokes and character entries, you can enable this feature in the Mac OS X Terminal app to secure keyboard entry and any command line input into the terminal.

### Mac builtin Terminal
Enable it for the build in Terminal on Macbook:

![SKI Terminal](http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/secure-keyboard-entry.jpg "Terminal enable SKI")

### iTerm2
Enable it for iTerm which a lot of people use (highly recommended)

(install iTerm2 in the terminal: ```brew cask install iterm2```. When you have installed Homebrew)

## Enable firewall and stealth mode
Built-in, basic firewall which blocks incoming connections only.
> Note: this firewall does not have the ability to monitor, nor block outgoing connections.

```
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on # enable fw
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setloggingmode on # enable logging
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on # dont respond to pings
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setallowsigned off
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setallowsignedapp off
sudo pkill -HUP socketfilterfw
```

Computer hackers scan networks so they can attempt to identify computers to attack. When stealth mode is enabled, your computer does not respond to ICMP ping requests, and does not answer to connection attempts from a closed TCP or UDP port.

# Install required software
The required software for this guide is:

* Homebrew
* PAM Yubico
* YubiKey Personalization Tools
* GPG 2
* dnsmasq
* OpenSSL
* LibreSSL

## Install Homebrew
Open a Terminal window and then run the following command to install Homebrew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## Install better packages
The version of OpenSSL in Sierra is 0.9.8zh which is not current. It doesn't support TLS 1.1 or newer, elliptic curve ciphers, and more.

Apple declares OpenSSL deprecated in their Cryptographic Services Guide document. Their version also has patches which may surprise you.

The version of Curl which comes with macOS uses Secure Transport for SSL/TLS validation.

```
brew install openssl
brew install curl
brew install wget
```

### Configure your shell
To use LibreSSL and curl installed by Homebrew, it is important to update your path. You can add the following to your shell profile. Currently we're using zsh where the file you need to alter is `~/.zshrc`

Add the following to the file:

```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"
```

Or for Mac with M1 chips

```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"
```

## Install dnscrypt
DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven't been tampered with.

To install DNSCrypt proxy, run the following command:

```
brew install dnscrypt-proxy
```

Once installed, you need to change the listen port for the service. Edit the file `/opt/homebrew/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml` and change the following line:

```
listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:53']
```

to

```
listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:40']
```

This way, dnscrypt-proxy will listen on port 40 instead, since we use dnsmasq to listen on port 53 which is the default dns port.

Restart dnscrypt-proxy to make the changes take affect:

```
sudo brew services restart dnscrypt-proxy
```

## Install dnsmasq
dnsmasq (short for DNS masquerade) is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder, designed to provide DNS (and optionally DHCP and TFTP) services to a small-scale network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.

```
brew install dnsmasq
```

Once installed, you'll need to change to configuration of dnsmasq. If you add dnscrypt also, the following config works. If you do not use dnscrypt, you will need to change the servers address from 127.0.0.1#40 to 1.1.1.1

Alter the following file `/opt/homebrew/etc/dnsmasq.conf` and add the following content to the end of the file:

```
listen-address=127.0.0.1
port=53
domain-needed
bogus-priv
filterwin2k
no-resolv
no-hosts
no-poll
cache-size=8192
min-cache-ttl=120
#no-negcache
rebind-localhost-ok
#stop-dns-rebind
strict-order
proxy-dnssec

local=/local/

# Custom development domains
address=/.dev/127.0.0.1
address=/.dom/127.0.0.1

# Upstream DNSCrypt
server=127.0.0.1#40

# Upstream CloudFlare
#server=1.1.1.2
#server=1.0.0.2
```

Restart dnsmasq to make sure changes are affected

```
sudo brew services restart dnsmasq
```

Then enable DNSMASQ for each interface on your Mac:

```
networksetup -listallnetworkservices 2>/dev/null | grep -v '*' | while read x ; do
    networksetup -setdnsservers "$x" 127.0.0.1 ::1
done
```

As an alternative, you can set the dns each time you open your terminal by adding:

```
# Set dns server to dnsmasq to force local cache
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" 127.0.0.1
```

to your `~/.zshrc` file - if you use ZSH.

### Block DNS queries
You should block all connections to other DNS servers as various programs use some sort of internal DNS resolver. Chrome has this build in, lots of programs also falls back to systemd's resolver. So to make sure we always use Stubby as DNS resolver, we simply just block all DNS connections to anything but Knot Resolver:

Start of by editing `/etc/pf.conf` and add the following line to the **end** of the file:

```
block drop quick on !lo0 proto udp from any to any port = 53
```

Then reload the firewall with:

```
sudo pfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf
```

Verify that the rule is active with:
```
pfctl -v -s rules
```

### Test dns
A quick test can be done by using dig (or your favorite DNS tool) on the loopback address

```
dig @127.0.0.1 www.example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.9.7-P3 <<>> @127.0.0.1 www.example.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd

```

You should also test and make sure you cannot use external DNS servers. The following should give you a timeout:

```
dig @8.8.8.8 www.example.com

; <<>> DiG 9.9.7-P3 <<>> @8.8.8.8 www.example.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```

## Install GPG
Open a Terminal window and then run the following commands:

```
brew install gnupg2 pinentry-mac coreutils
```

## Install YubiKey Personalization Tools
Install the latest version of the YubiKey Personalization Tool

https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubikey-personalization-tools/

# Configure your YubiKey
Open the YubiKey Personalization Tool from your program folder on your Macbook and insert the YubiKey in a USB port on your Mac.

1. Open the "Settings tab at the top of the window, and ensure that the "Logging Settings"
section has logging enabled, and the “Yubico Format“ selected.

2. Open the “Challenge Response” tab at the top of the window. Then configure slot 2:

  1. Select Configuration Slot 2
  2. Select Variable input for HMAC-SHA1 Mode
  3. Click Generate to generate a new Secret Key (20 bytes Hex)
  4. Make sure it the box is `unchecked` for "Require user input (button press)"
  5. Click Write Configuration

![Set Yubikey options](https://crewjam.com/images/YubiKey_Personalization_Tool_and_MacOS_X_Challenge-Response.png "YubiKey Personalization Tool")

You must configure both the YubiKeys with the Challenge-Response mode now.

# Install PAM Yubico
Open a Terminal window, and run the following command:
```
brew install pam_yubico
```

## Configure PAM on your Macbook
Open a Terminal window, and run the following command as your regular user, with firstly the YubiKey inserted.

> Note: If you have secure keyboard input enabled for your terminal, this will give an error. Disable while you run the commands and reenable it.

```
mkdir –p ~/.yubico
chmod -R 0700 ~/.yubico
ykpamcfg -2
```

Your YubiKey are now setup with your Macbook and can be used. You should store the backup YubiKey somewhere safe for recovery - like in a vault in your bank ;)

## Enable YubiKey for Auth, Sudo and Screensaver
Before you proceed, you should verify you have the `/usr/local/lib/security/pam_yubico.so` or `/opt/homebrew/lib/security/pam_yubico.so` file present on your Macbook from your earlier preparations. If you dont, you will lock your self out of your Macbook now.

Edit the following files:

* /etc/pam.d/authorization
* /etc/pam.d/sudo
* /etc/pam.d/screensaver

You need to use sudo to do so. From the terminal issue the following command:

```
sudo vi /etc/pam.d/screensaver
```

Add the following to the file:

```
auth       required       /usr/local/lib/security/pam_yubico.so mode=challenge-response
```

Or below for Mac's with M1

```
auth       required       /opt/homebrew/lib/security/pam_yubico.so mode=challenge-response
```

Ending up with something like this

```
auth       optional       pam_krb5.so use_first_pass use_kcminit
auth       required       pam_opendirectory.so use_first_pass nullok
auth       required       /usr/local/lib/security/pam_yubico.so mode=challenge-response
account    required       pam_opendirectory.so
account    sufficient     pam_self.so
account    required       pam_group.so no_warn group=admin,wheel fail_safe
account    required       pam_group.so no_warn deny group=admin,wheel ruser fail_safe
```

Also remember to set the screensaver to require password or it wont work anyway :)

![Mac screensaver](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BwMhk.png "Macbook Screensaver Password")

Before you alter the `sudo` and `authorization` files, you can verify everything works by enabling the screensaver first. If you cannot login from the screensaver while the YubiKey is present, something is terrible wrong now and you should NOT continue.

Use the screensaver to check both the YubiKeys before you proceed.

# Enable Yubikeylockd
Yubikeylockd is a simple daemon that locks your computer (starts the screensaver) when you unplug the YubiKey. This is ideal for when you leave the computer and you simply just take the YubiKey out and it will simply lock automatically.

To install Yubikeylockd, open a Terminal and enter the following command:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shtirlic/yubikeylockd/master/yubikeylockd.rb
```

When brew is done, you need to enable the service. Enter the following command:

```
sudo brew services start yubikeylockd
```

## Disable yubikeylockd
If you somehow do not want to have Yubikeylockd enabled anymore, yet we wouldn't recommend it. Open a Terminal and enter the following command:

```
sudo brew services stop yubikeylockd
```

# Prepare GPG
We need a RAM disk on the Mac for when we generate a random key. A 4 gigabyte RAM disk can be created with the following command:

```
diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAMDisk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://8388608`
```

Create a new `gpg.conf` in the ram disk directory

```
cat << EOF > /Volumes/RAMDisk/gpg.conf
use-agent
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES CAST5
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
cert-digest-algo SHA512
s2k-digest-algo SHA512
s2k-cipher-algo AES256
charset utf-8
fixed-list-mode
no-comments
no-emit-version
keyid-format 0xlong
list-options show-uid-validity
verify-options show-uid-validity
with-fingerprint
EOF
```

And make sure GPG starts using it and language is English and we have set the right permissions on files. Do not close the Terminal after this, as you need the exported variables present in your shell.

```
export GNUPGHOME=/Volumes/RAMDisk
export LANG=en
umask 070
```

## Generating the Primary Key
Use the `same terminal session` you ran the export of GNUPGHOME in when continuing the next steps.

Generate a new key with GPG, selecting RSA (sign only) and the appropriate keysize, optionally specifying an expiry:

```
gpg --full-generate-key

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 4

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096

Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire

      <n>y = key expires in n years

Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all

Is this correct? (y/N) y

You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: Dr Duh
Email address: doc@duh.to

Note that this key cannot be used for encryption.  You may want to use
the command "--edit-key" to generate a subkey for this purpose.
```

### Save Key ID
Export the key ID as a variable for use throughout:

```
export KEYID=0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB
```

This step is important. You can see the key id from one of the last lines in the output from above:

```
pub   4096R/0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB 2016-05-24
```

### Create revocation certificate
Create a way to revoke your keys in case of loss or compromise, an explicit reason being optional

```
gpg --gen-revoke $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/revoke.txt

sec  4096R/0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB 2016-05-24 Dr Duh <doc@duh.to>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y

Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 1

Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
> (Press enter)

Reason for revocation: Key has been compromised
(No description given)

Is this okay? (y/N) y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

4096-bit RSA key, ID 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB, created 2016-05-24

ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
```

### Back up master key
Save a copy of the private key block:

```
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/master.key
```

### Create subkeys
Edit the key to add subkeys:

```
gpg --expert --edit-key $KEYID

Secret key is available.

```

Then save your work

```
gpg> save
```

### Check your work
List your new secret keys:

```
gpg --list-secret-keys

/Volumes/RAMDisk/pubring.kbx

ssb   2048R/0x3F29127E79649A3D 2016-05-24
```

### Export subkeys
Save a copy of your subkeys:
```
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/mastersub.key
gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/sub.key
```

### Export public keys
This file should be publicly shared:

```
gpg --armor --export $KEYID > $HOME/pubkey.txt
```

Optionally, it may be uploaded to a public keyserver (without id verification - not searchable by email address):

```
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key $KEYID
```

Optionally, it may be uploaded to a public keyserver (with id verification - searchable by email address):

```
gpg --export me@here.com | curl -T - https://keys.openpgp.org
```

After a little while, it ought to propagate to other servers.

### Back up everything
Once keys are moved to hardware, they cannot be extracted again (otherwise, what would be the point?), so make sure you have made an encrypted backup before proceeding.

We recommend to back up the keys to an encrypted USB device. You will need this backup in case you LOSE your YubiKey and need to create a new one

# Configure YubiKey as SmartCard
Plug in your YubiKey and enter the following command in a Terminal:

```
gpg --card-edit

Reader ...........: Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP U2F CCID

## Change PINs
The default PIN codes are `12345678` for admin and `123456` for default use. You will need to use the default pin on everyday basis when you need to use the ssh key for auth. The Admin key is only if you want to alter data on the card.

Do not lose these pins EVER or you'll have to reset the card with the included `yubikey-reset.sh` script in this repo.

```

## Securely cleanup
When you are done, and you have made a backup of your work to an ENCRYPTED usb-drive, issue a secure erase of the RAM disk:

```
gshred -zun 12 /Volumes/RAMDisk/*
```

And unmount the RAM disk again

```
diskutil unmountDisk force /Volumes/RAMDisk
```

When you have erased and unmounted the RAM disk, reboot your Macbook and you are all set with a more secure Macbook.

# Using the Keys on your Macbook
Start by opening a new terminal session and paste the following text into a terminal window to create a recommended GPG configuration:
```

## Import public key into your keyring
Import it from a file:

```
gpg --import < $HOME/pubkey.txt
gpg: key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB: public key "Dr Duh <doc@duh.to>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
```

## Trust master key
Edit the imported key to assign it ultimate trust:
```
gpg --edit-key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB

Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
unless you restart the program.

gpg> quit
```

## Update your Shell Environment
For pretty much all shells. I use `zsh`, so i alter the `~/.zshrc` file:

```
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket);
```

## Restart
To make changes take affect, please restart the GPG agent `in a new terminal where GPG_TTY and SSH_AUTH_SOCK is set`:

```
gpg-connect-agent killagent /bye
gpg-connect-agent /bye
```

## Verify your work
There is a -L option of ssh-add that lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented by the agent. Copy and paste the following output to the server authorized_keys file:

```
ssh-add -L
ssh-rsa AAAAB4NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAz[...]zreOKM+HwpkHzcy9DQcVG2Nw== cardno:000605553211
```

If you see a SSH key with the `cardno:` descriptions, you have now successfully setup a SSH key on your YubiKey.

You can now copy this public key to the servers you want to use it on etc.

# Misc
Different information and help.

## Loss of Yubikey
In case you lose your YubiKey, everything is not yet over and data is not yet lost. If you have another YubiKey nearby, you can simply redeploy the secure keys to a new YubiKey.

### Access to private SSH key
Start by recreating the RAMDisk drive with hdutil as done when you created the keys. Next, copy back all the files from your secure backup you took, to the RAMDisk.
When files are in place, run the export commands again to set the GNUPGHOME folder to the RAMDisk. Next, list your keys with keygrip:

```
gpg -k --with-keygrip

/Volumes/RAMDisk/pubring.kbx
------------------------------
pub   rsa2048/93BDD96B 2017-06-29 [SC]
      D03833D3D52F5FFCCC73452461671825E8DEC139
      Keygrip = 8A6CDC5FCE05A5B251BD8C397B269607534B4702
uid         [ultimate] Big John <big.john@gmail.com>
sub   rsa2048/0424163D 2017-06-29 [E]
      Keygrip = E110250E32B811D45879A66F487CE95BC1906D77
sub   rsa2048/8F228EDB 2017-06-29 [A]
      Keygrip = 32BC5688805A640D495E8A7B41EC78F74E77E098
```

Grab the unique id from the Authentication key which is the key with the [A] next to it. Add that keygrip to GNUPG's sshcontrol:

```
echo 32BC5688805A640D495E8A7B41EC78F74E77E098 > /Volumes/RAMDisk/sshcontrol
```

You need to copy the gpg-agent config to your RAMDisk too:

```
cp ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf /Volumes/RAMDisk
```

Then export the SSH_AUTH_SOCK to point to the RAMDisk instead and restart your gpg agent:

```
export "SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/Volumes/RAMDisk/S.gpg-agent.ssh"

gpg-connect-agent killagent /bye
gpg-connect-agent /bye
```

You can verify that SSH is now able to see the private key from your keyring by issuing `ssh-add -L`

## Requiring touch to authenticate
By default the YubiKey will perform key operations without requiring a touch from the user. To require a touch for every SSH connection, use the [YubiKey Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/) (you'll need the Admin PIN):

```
ykman openpgp touch aut on
```

To require a touch for the signing and encrypting keys as well:

```
ykman openpgp touch sig on
ykman openpgp touch enc on
```

The YubiKey will blink when it's waiting for the touch.

## Change YubiKey Mode
We also need to set the YubiKey mode to OTP/U2F/CCID. My YubiKey 4 was pr. default in this mode. See more at https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/Mode_switch_YubiKey.html

If you prefer a GUI, install the YubiKey Neo Manager: https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-neo-manager - works with YubiKey 4 too.
